# Customer-Churn-Predictive-Analytics-Suite
Unlock actionable insights and prediction power from customer churn with advanced EDA, interactive dashboards, and state-of-the-art machine learning models.

# Project Overview
The Customer Churn Analytics Suite is a comprehensive toolkit designed to analyze, visualize, and predict customer churn. This project includes in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualizations, and advanced machine learning models to not only understand churn drivers but also to build accurate churn prediction models.

# Features
* Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) covering key customer churn drivers

* Interactive and visually rich dashboards built with Streamlit and Dash

* Implementation of multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble methods

* Comprehensive model evaluation and comparison to identify best-performing techniques

* Clear, actionable business insights to help reduce customer churn

# Tech Stack
Python: `(Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)`

Visualization: `Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly`
